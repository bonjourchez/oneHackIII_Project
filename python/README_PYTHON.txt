OKAY SO HERE IS HOW THE PYTHON CODE Works

1. we gotta install the LIBRARY 
#must install revChatGPT by running the following command
#python -m pip install --upgrade revChatGPT

2. okay so library is good now there are a couple things that are important
access_token.txt contains the authenitcation for the chatgpt account, DO NOT TOUCH It
gpt_text_parser has a user-input variable, this is what's inputted from the website.

3. the program outputs a json (VARIABLE NAME IS JSON) that goes into this API link
